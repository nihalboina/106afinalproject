Brief overview:

in_gen (instruction generation)

--everything that goes from taking in the user input, image input to get to how to get to placing instructions

1. output generation (using gpt to get output csv of some sorts)

2. input mapping (using cv full position + orientation of all blocks)

instruction generation (some algo stuff to put combine 1. + 2. to get from list of input poses to output poses)


in_exec (instruction execution)

PID stuff to go from all instructions to executing properly
